# Photo Upload System - Setup Guide

## üîß Automated Configuration with GitHub Actions

This system uses GitHub Actions for secure, automated deployment. No manual configuration files needed!

### 1. GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. Go to GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens ‚Üí Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token" ‚Üí "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Set expiration to "No expiration" (or your preferred timeframe)
4. Select these scopes:
   - ‚úÖ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - ‚úÖ `public_repo` (Access to public repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **IMPORTANT**: Copy the token immediately (you won't see it again)

### 2. Configure Repository Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
2. Click "New repository secret" and add:
   - **Name**: `GRISSI_TOKEN_PAT`
   - **Value**: The token from step 1
3. Click "New repository secret" again and add:
   - **Name**: `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
   - **Value**: Your desired admin password (choose something secure)

### 3. Deployment Process

The system automatically deploys when you make changes to the admin folder:

1. Any commit to the `master` branch that modifies files in the `admin/` folder triggers deployment
2. GitHub Actions securely injects your secrets into the configuration
3. The admin interface is deployed to GitHub Pages at `/admin/`
4. No sensitive data is ever committed to your repository

### Manual Deployment (Optional)

You can also trigger deployment manually:
1. Go to your repository ‚Üí Actions
2. Select "Deploy Admin Interface" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### Access the Upload Interface
1. Navigate to: `https://your-site-url/admin/photo-upload.html`
2. Enter the password you configured
3. Start uploading photos!

### Upload Process
1. **Select Files**: Drag & drop or click to select image files
2. **Match to People**: For each photo, select which family member it belongs to
3. **Upload**: Click "Upload All Photos" to start the GitHub upload process
4. **Wait**: Photos will be uploaded directly to your GitHub repository
5. **Auto-Deploy**: GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild and deploy (2-3 minutes)

### Supported Formats
- JPG/JPEG
- PNG  
- GIF
- WebP
- Maximum file size: 5MB per photo

## üîí Security Considerations

### Token Security
- The GitHub token will be visible in the browser's source code
- Only share the upload URL with trusted family members
- Consider using a token with minimal required permissions
- Monitor your GitHub repository for unauthorized changes

### Password Protection
- The password provides basic protection but is not encryption
- It's stored in plain text in the JavaScript file
- Consider changing it periodically

### Access Control
- The upload page is not linked from the main site
- Use robots.txt to prevent search engine indexing
- Consider adding IP restrictions if needed

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Configuration not found" error:**
- Make sure you've set the GitHub token and owner in photo-upload.js

**Upload fails:**
- Check that your GitHub token has the correct permissions
- Verify the repository name and owner are correct
- Check your internet connection

**Photos don't appear on site:**
- GitHub Pages rebuild can take 2-10 minutes
- Check the GitHub repository to confirm files were uploaded
- Clear your browser cache

### GitHub API Limits
- GitHub API allows 5000 requests per hour for authenticated users
- Each photo upload uses 1-2 API calls
- You can upload approximately 2000+ photos per hour

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify your GitHub token permissions
3. Ensure the repository settings allow API access
4. Test with a single small image file first

## üîÑ Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- Automatic photo manifest updates
- Batch thumbnail generation
- Upload progress for individual files
- Photo compression before upload
- Duplicate photo detection
